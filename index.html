  <h1>The Personal Page of Ryan Willett</h1>
  <p>Hey, how's it hanging? This is my personal webpage, where you can learn some information about me. I'm a freshman at the University at Buffalo, intended Computer Science major, and I work at Tops as a cashier. I've lived in Cheektowaga, about 20 minutes away from campus, for the past 10 years and I lived in South Buffalo before then. I play vidya games sometimes, I'm into pop punk, and I like writing occasionally. There you go. All the basic filler info you need about me. Catch you later.
  </p>
  <p>Here's an unordered list of some of the activities I enjoy, some of which I listed above.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Video games</li>
  <li>Pop punk</li>
    <li>Actually, music in general. It's pretty rad.</li>
      <li>Web site design</li>
      <li>Programming</li>
  </ul>
      <p>And here's some Idubbbz</p>
