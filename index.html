  <h1>The Personal Page of Ryan Willett aka "knucklebump557"</h1>
  <p>Hey, how's it hanging? This is where you can find out some more about my Youtube channel. This is my personal webpage as well, where you can learn some information about me. I'm a freshman at the University at Buffalo, intended Computer Science major, and I work at Tops as a cashier. I've lived in Cheektowaga, about 20 minutes away from campus, for the past 10 years and I lived in South Buffalo before then. I play vidya games sometimes, I'm into pop punk, and I like writing occasionally. There you go. All the basic filler info you need about me. Catch you later.</p>
  <h1>Youtube Channel</h1>
  <p> So yeah, I run the Youtube channel knucklebump557. There, you can find a bunch of different kinds of videos. These can be LP's (let's plays) of video games, commentaries, discussion-type videos, "reviews", skits, countdowns, and more. Overall, it's just a bunch of fun and I highly encourage you all to go check it out as soon as you can. New content is being uploaded as soon as I can make it, so just bear with me on that. I promise you won't regret it<</p>
